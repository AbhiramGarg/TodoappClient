# MERN Stack Todo Application - Frontend

This repository houses the frontend for a full-stack Todo application, built using the MERN architecture. This frontend, powered by React and Redux, provides a dynamic and responsive user interface for managing todo lists.

**Key Technologies:**

* ⚛️ **React:** For building the interactive user interface, providing a component-based architecture for efficient development.
* 📦 **Redux:** For centralized state management, ensuring predictable state updates across the application, especially for user authentication and todo data.
* ⚡ **Vite:** As the build tool, enabling rapid development with its fast hot module replacement and optimized builds.
* 📡 **Axios:** For handling HTTP requests to the backend API, facilitating data exchange between the frontend and backend.
* 🛣️ **React Router:** For client-side routing, enabling seamless navigation between different views like user authentication and todo list management.

**Application Features:**

* 🔑 User authentication (sign-up and sign-in).
* 📝 Creation, deletion, and updating of todo items.
* 💾 User-specific todo list storage, with data persisted in a MongoDB database through a backend API.
* 📱 A responsive design to ensure usability across various devices.
